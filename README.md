# remindMe
This project will solely be a reminders app, very similar in functionality to Apple's core Reminders app on macOS/iOS. The purpose of this project is to showcase my capabilities regarding the technologies being used.

## Technologies involved:
- TypeScript (programming language)
- React.js (front-end framework)
- Node.js and Express.js (back-end framework)
- AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) for infrastructure as code
- Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) with PostgreSQL as the database.
